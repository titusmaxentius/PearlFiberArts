# Project Source Folders
Over the course of workflow development, we've switched from strict Kniterate development and branched out to additional development pipelines. In order to maintain clean source management, every new project will be created as a branch, and then merged back to the main development stream. 

## Current Project List
- Jacquard Coat: IN DEVELOPMENT
- 6 Swirl Hat: IN TESTING
