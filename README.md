# Pearl Fiber Arts
## Collaboration between Robert Warner and Pearl Fiber Arts to document and build using the Kniterate knitting machine. 

### Purpose: Storage of tracked KCODE files and corresponding design files for the machine
KCODE files are the Kniterate proprietary files for running the machine; these files must have a specific sequence in order to work. These will correspond to AI/EPS/PDF/SVG files with the detail of the design. 

### File Structure: 
* (Design Name) 
  * Compiled KCODE file (command.kc) 
  * Compiled KCODE file (design.kc) 
  * Design Files 
    * AI/SVG Reference Graph
    * XML with instructions, tension, and notes about the pattern
    * Any additional images (photos, etc. of pieces, errors, etc.)
