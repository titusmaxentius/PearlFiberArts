			<title>Getting Started with the Design Studio</title>
			<para>This is going to be a purposefully misleading chapter. 
			Don&apos;t worry - this isn&apos;t the only time I will do this. 
			Chances are, this is going to be the first introduction to working 
			with KCODE. KCODE is a low-level language based on GCODE, a standard 
			language developed in the 1950s for use with machine cutting tools. 
			The basic premise, of course, is that you have a physical machine 
			that needs to be told how to move the needles, the jacks, the 
			carriages, and the yarn feeders, to produce output that the user is 
			expecting. Unfortunately, KCODE isn&apos;t particularly user 
			friendly. </para>
			<para>GCODE is, quite simply, the low-level mathematical language 
			used to control CNC machines. There have been many variants over the 
			years, but the concepts remain the same. You have a blade, or other 
			aparatus, that only moves in one direction. Then, you have a plate, 
			that moves on three axis (or more, depending on how complex the 
			machine is). The plate has to move in controlled defined directions, 
			to create the final piece. </para>
			<para>KCODE is the same. The machine itself doesn&apos;t know, for 
			example, where various yarn feeders are - the KCODE instructions 
			tell the machine where to go to get the feeders from. Telling the 
			machine to knit Fair Isle means nothing to a Kniterate; instead, in 
			the KCODE, you would define the needle sequence, and which color 
			should be applied to each needle. </para>
